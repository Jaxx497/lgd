# libgen-dl

A fork of [libgen-downloader](https://github.com/obsfx/libgen-downloader) by Ömercan Balandı (WTFPL, see `LICENSE`) that focuses on quality-of-life improvements to the terminal app, plus an Android port.

The list of mirrors is still fetched from the original project's [configuration](https://github.com/obsfx/libgen-downloader/blob/configuration/config.v3.json) branch. To find mirrors yourself, see https://open-slum.org/.

## Install

### Terminal

Linux and macOS:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaxx497/libgen-dl/master/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaxx497/libgen-dl/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both download the latest standalone executable (no Node needed) and set up `lgd` as a short name too; run them again to update. There is no prebuilt binary for Intel Macs: build from source. Or grab a binary yourself from the [Releases](https://github.com/Jaxx497/libgen-dl/releases) page.

To build from source instead (needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+):

```
git clone https://github.com/Jaxx497/libgen-dl
cd libgen-dl
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g .
libgen-dl
```

### Android

Download the APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/Jaxx497/libgen-dl/releases) page and open it on your phone (allow installing from your browser or file manager when asked).

Downloads are saved to the phone's Downloads folder; the ⚙ button picks a different one. **Open** launches a finished file in a reader app. The ⤓ button lists this session's downloads, with **Stop** for running and queued ones.

## Usage

```
libgen-dl                           interactive mode
libgen-dl -s "The Art of War"       start with a search
libgen-dl -s "art of war" -e epub   only show epub results ("-e all" for every type)
libgen-dl -d <MD5> -o ~/books       download one file into ~/books
libgen-dl -b <MD5LIST.txt>          download every MD5 in a file (one per line)
libgen-dl -u <MD5>                  print the download URL
libgen-dl -h                        help
```

`lgd` still works as a short alias for `libgen-dl`.

`-b` and `-d` exit with code 1 if any download failed.

Existing files are never overwritten: a second copy is saved as `name(1).ext`.

### Config

`~/.config/libgen-dl/config.json` is created on first run (an existing `~/.config/lgd` from before the rename is moved there) with every option commented out. Lines starting with `//` are comments.

```jsonc
{
  // default: current directory
  "downloadDir": "~/books",
  // default: all filetypes
  "extensions": ["pdf", "epub"],
  // also available: language, pages, publisher
  "columns": ["index", "ext", "title", "authors", "year", "size"],
  // list books in this language first; default: mirror order
  "language": "English",
  // tried first; see open-slum.org for mirrors
  "mirror": "https://libgen.li",
}
```

Command-line flags override the file.

## Signing (maintainers)

The APK is signed with one release key so every version installs over the last. The keystore and its password live outside the repo, as the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE` (base64) and `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` repository secrets; the key alias is `libgen-dl`. Losing the keystore means no future APK can install over an existing one, so keep a backup.
